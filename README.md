# Data-Cleaning-with-MYSQL
This project makes use of MYSQL to clean layoff datasets of several companies. 
in this project, i imported csv file into MYSQL, duplicated the
 data twice so as to keep the original data 
 i removed duplicates , removed unwanted rows, updated the data set,
 filled unnecessary empty spaces and put the data ready for exploring.
